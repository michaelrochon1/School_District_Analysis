# School_District_Analysis
An analysis of school district data, including grades, and budgets in an attempt to find usable correlations or patterns.

We have reduced all null variables from the dataset, as well as any duplicates, to ensure that our analysis would not be skewed by these issues. From there we divided data into individual schools as well as Charter vs Public schools. These categories of analysis allowed us to analyze the data in a way that could prove useful to policy makers, school boards, teachers, and parents. 

Our findings suggest that charter schools outperform public schools in math and reading. One anomaly noticed is that charter schools show lower scores in grade 12 than public schools. On average however, the charter schools do perform better. We've also found that Montgomery High School has the most students than the rest of the schools in the dataset. Matthew Thomas scored the lowest among all students in the dataset on their reading score however that does not suggest that Dixon High has bad test scores in reading, as they are on average in the mid 70s.

There are plenty more angles of analysis that could be used on this dataset, including the comparison of budget per student, or the correlation from individual schools and high test scores. Much more granular analysis can be performed on this dataset with many more conclusions.
